# A-Simple-Database-Program
The purpose of this project was to build a very simple database program using B-Trees for record storage. The first thing the program does is to read in the student names, IDs, and grades from their respective files and store the result in a B-Tree. The last part required writing a simple command interpreter which provides the user interface to the program.
